### **📖 A Word from the Author**

My journey into 3D data science began not with mind-blowing algorithms but with mud-caked boots. I was a land surveyor, meticulously translating the real world into digital plans, one point at a time. The thrill of discovery was long gone, replaced by a sense of repetitive routine.

One evening, staring at a .csv file of 2,587 data points, I had my spark moment: “Couldn’t this be automated?” That question, fueled by a late-night cup of coffee, changed everything. It sent me down a rabbit hole of research, leading me to the world of 3D data science. The learning curve was steep, but the journey unfolded one exciting discovery after another.

This book is for you, the curious mind who wants to break free from routine and unlock the potential of 3D data. Remember, groundbreaking discoveries often begin with a simple question. Are you ready to ask yours?
