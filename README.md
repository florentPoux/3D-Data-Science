| **Hands-On Learning** | Every concept is reinforced with real-world datasets and production-ready Python code |
| **Complete Coverage** | From point cloud fundamentals to PointNet deep learning architectures |
| **Build Real Tools** | Create your own 3D viewers, analytical apps, and ML pipelines from scratch |
| **Industry-Ready Skills** | Prepare for careers in robotics, autonomous vehicles, geospatial analysis, digital twins, and more |

### A Note from the Author

> *"My journey into 3D data science began not with algorithms but with mud-caked boots as a land surveyor. One evening, staring at a .csv file of 2,587 data points, I had my spark moment: 'Couldn't this be automated?'*
>
> *That question changed everything. This book is for you—the curious mind ready to unlock the potential of 3D data. Groundbreaking discoveries often begin with a simple question. Are you ready to ask yours?"*
>
> — **Florent Poux**
